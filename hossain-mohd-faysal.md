My name is **MEL**, and this is my personal blog.  

I am a Wife, Mother, and Educator.  Due to a tremendous blessing of GOD a door has opened for me to stay at home and work therefore less time my baby is a way from me.

I have a Bachelors in Math from MSU, my  Masters in Education from LA College (best school ever) am obtaining Gifted Certification from NSULA, and also graduated as a Massage Therapist from LA Institute of MT.

My husband is a minister of [Livingway UPC](http://www.livingway.cc) and working on his degree as well.  He also maintains a onsite second job so that I may have less pressure in our financial area.
God is good.  

I am currently tutoring with [WeRTeachers](https://werteachers.com/page/profile/170600218), teaching EsL at [51 Talk](http://www.51talk.com/na?referrer=4825373), and the new local coordinater for [CCI Greenheart Foreign Exchange](https://www.cci-exchange.com/)

I have also joined FREECODECAMP.org in order to gain coding knowledge and possibly obtain another avenue to work from home.  I highly recommend this site for anyone intersted.  It is totallt free and you can gain certifications by doing projects for Nonprofits. (I am not at that level yet.)  It's a great way to try it out for FREE!

It was through them that I discovered Github, Prose.io, Jekyll, and made with the help of a creators generosity, my first website.

I
make
stuff.


*Beautiful, practical, meaningful stuff.*


I make what I love.

*I love what I do.*


But over the years, I noticed that somehow, along the way, software designed to help us be creative, actually made us less creative. That's because we believe our best ideas emerge when we use pencils and paper.
So I set out to build tools that work the way I do.


Tools for the creative space â€” the 53 centimeters that magically link head, heart, and hand. Tools as simple as pencil and paper. Tools so essential, I  really can't imagine work without them.
