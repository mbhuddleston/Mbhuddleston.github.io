My name is **MEL**, and this is my personal blog.  

I am a Wife, Mother, and Educator.  Due to a tremendous blessing of GOD a door has opened for me to stay at home and work therefore less time my baby is a way from me.

I have a Bachelors in Math from MSU, my  Masters in Education from LA College (best school ever) am obtaining Gifted Certification from NSULA, and also graduated as a Massage Therapist from LA Institute of MT.

My husband is a minister of [Livingway UPC](http://www.livingway.cc) and working on his degree as well.  He also maintains a onsite second job so that I may have less pressure in our financial area.
God is good.  

I am currently tutoring with [WeRTeachers](https://werteachers.com/page/profile/170600218), teaching EsL at [51 Talk](http://www.51talk.com/na?referrer=4825373), and the new local coordinater for [CCI Greenheart Foreign Exchange](https://www.cci-exchange.com/)

I have also joined FREECODECAMP.org in order to gain coding knowledge and possibly obtain another avenue to work from home.  I highly recommend this site for anyone intersted.  It is totallt free and you can gain certifications by doing projects for Nonprofits. (I am not at that level yet.)  It's a great way to try it out for FREE!

It was through them that I discovered Github, Prose.io, Jekyll, and made with the help of a creators generosity, my first website.

*I love what I do now.*
