<h11.><a href="http://hairprint.refr.cc/7NTPCWL">Hairprint</a></h1>

<p>I have used <a href="http://hairprint.refr.cc/7NTPCWL">Hairprint</a> twice. I have dark brown hair with natural highlights. I have never died my hair whatsoever, recently had a baby, and my water is damaging my hair. After the second use I noticed a noticeable difference not only in the grey being gone but also in the glowing texture of my hair.</p>

<p>Now I will preface this by mentioning that due to the length of my hair it was suggested I use more kits. So, I believe had I listened to this I would have noticed a tremendous difference the first use.</p>

<p>Hairprint is not hair dye, it will NOt damage your hair. I am proof as my hair has been falling out and breaking due to the stress of labor, hard water, and other factors. I noticed split ends were way less noticeable after the first use.</p>

<p>Once I begin using <a href="http://hairprint.refr.cc/7NTPCWL">Hairprint</a> consistently I believe I will see a tremendous difference. <a href="http://hairprint.refr.cc/7NTPCWL">Hairprint</a> only works for dark hair, it does not work for those with blonde hair although they are working on it.</p>

<p>I had no experience in putting anything like this on my hair. I even went longer by accident and felt no adverse effects. What is wonderful about this product is that you could technically eat all the ingredients. So I do not feel like a person would damage their hair at all by using it.</p>

<p>It may not be the perfect natural color at first but in a day or so it will become the color you once had years ago!</p>
