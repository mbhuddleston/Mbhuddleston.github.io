So, much to my families amazement, I have turned down several job offers not meeting my new stress level requirements.  If I feel like the atmosphere will cause me days of tears, too little time with my child, or even danger physically, I shall say no. 
Do we have the means to make it with one income? No.  So GOD opened a door that with his help, will be enough, considering, no school lesson costs, less illness,  less babysitter needed, zero gas, and less food costs.  These alone account for $1000-$1500 per month.
There are no Benefits, but I feel like God will make all the difference and lead me accordingly.
I am not lazy and turned down nothing good, He will provide for us and bless me for choosing more God and family time over mere money.  I will be blogging my experience to give tips to those wanting to move to 51TALK too.  CLICK THE LINK BELOW TO SIGN Up for an INTERVIEW NOW!
