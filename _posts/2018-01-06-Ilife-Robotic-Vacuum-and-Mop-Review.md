title: ILife Robotic Vacuum and Mop Review!
---
##ILIFE is a Favorite Gift for 2017

Ilife is a less expensive Robotic Vaccuum with versions availbe between 10-230$. I have always desired a Robotic vacuum and never thought I would receive one :)


Although much cheaper than other well known brands, ILife has many reviews on Amazon and they are mostly excellent. I have to say from my experience it is WONDERFUL!!

This is a photo of Ilife in the box. ![iLife in box.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/iLife%20in%20box.jpg)

when you open the top of the Ilife robotic vaccuum the above is the easy to switch out case which picks up the dirt or distributes water for mopping. It is super easy to pull out and it comes with two: one for mopping and one for vaccuuming. ![iLife inside.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/iLife%20inside.jpg)

Ilife also comes with this Microfiber Mopping attachment. It is easily placed on the bottom and does an excellent job of mopping (Just don't forget to switch out the inner compartment so water will be distributed :))  ![iLife mop.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/iLife%20mop.jpg)

ILife is shorter than the more notable Robotic Vaccuums and easily slides under most tables, couches, beds, etc... with ease.  ![iLife under table.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/iLife%20under%20table.jpg)


What I really like about the Ilife is I have noticed it get caught up in cords but because of the way the brushes are placed, the item will not be hurt as would be with a normal vaccuum. It won't pull the cord inside the actual vaccuum. It will just wrap around the brush. The only way the item would be hurt is if Ilife was successful in pulling on the cord enough to knock down the item. So it is a wise idea to make sure all cords are placed in a way to be hanging above the height of the ILife. I myself did this and avoided all issues.


Also, when ILife does get stuck on an item it will eventually shut down. This is also a wonderful safety feature to avoid being worried about the vaccuum working when you are gone or asleep. Lastly the ILife will also automatically shut down when the inner compartment picking up the trash or debris is full. Once full and near to overflowing it will stop in its tracks thus avoiding any issues or trash being released back on the floor.


We have only been using it since Christmas. But so far I only have great things to say about it. For a low end version of a robotic vaccuum it is AWESOME!!! Get it today!!!!
