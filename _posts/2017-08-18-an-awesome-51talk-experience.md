title: An Awesome 51Talk Experience

## FABULOUS Time
I have completed 5 sessions all different ages and different levels.  

As a teacher continuously in this predicament teaching Math, it is no easy task to differentiate material so personally, especially for a subject you have never taught.  

51TALK (http://www.51talk.com/na?referrer=4825373)  has done this seemlessly for the teacher.  Students are learning and engaged.  It is thus far a "breath of fresh air" letting me see I do enjoy teaching and I can be successful with the right support.

JOIN NOW!  Even as a side job it would probably be a boost of confidence for those teachers encircled in a negative environment.
