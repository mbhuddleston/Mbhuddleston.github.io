###What is TPR?

Total physical response is an approach to teaching second language that was developed in the 1970s by James Asher, professor of Psychology at the San Jose State University in California.

Asher observed that traditional second language programs had an enormouse dropout rate, nearly 95%. Asher believed it could be due to methods not entirely effective.  However, he also notices children learned their first languages seemingly so easily.  What was the difference?

He then decided to recreate how we all learn our first languages as children.  This was the birth of TPR.

Asher saw that children’s early language repertoire consisted mainly of listening to adults telling them what to do: “Pick up the ball.” “Sit down.” “Open your mouth.” “Look at me.”

The child would look to the parents for instructions, and then perform the movements required. The child didn’t need to be able to say the words, only to listen and understand. Comprehension was the first step to language acquisition, not word production.

Asher adopted this practice and the simple listen and respond technique now sits at the heart of TPR. It’s been proven effective for teaching beginners of foreign languages. For example, you could teach “¡Siéntense!” (sit down) in a Spanish class by repeatedly sitting down and saying “Siéntense.” You can ask the class to join you in sitting down, even making a game out of it, or commenting on the manner that some students sit.

The act of moving is memory-friendly. By virtue of seeing you sit down, or experiencing the act themselves, your students will easily associate sitting down with siéntense. There’s something about the pairing of movement and language that’s so innate that children—without the help of textbooks—easily acquire language.

With TPR, not only do you have an approach that engages the energies of your students, you have a tool that creates memorable meaning through movement.

Just as TPR borrowed plenty of techniques and insights from psychologists and linguists like Dr. Krashen, it has also bequeathed a lot to approaches like TPRS (teaching proficiency through reading and storytelling).

Of course, TPR should not be used in isolation, but as one of many teaching tools in a language teacher’s bag.
