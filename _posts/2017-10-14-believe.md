## We can do whatever we believe.

Even the Bible states with a little faith the size of a mustard seed, we can ask what we will and it shall be done. We can speak to the mountain and it shall be cast into the sea.

PRAYER is the key. 

PRAYER without ceasing opens the door.

PRAYER without a tiny grain of faith, is no existent.

One example is my desire to be home with my baby... My bad year last year led me to leave my parish and comfortable job of over 9 years (with tenure) and work for [51TALK](http://www.51talk.com/na?referrer=4825373).

It's working, I love it, and I love real time with my husband and son!

Did I have a lot of faith? NO! Did I have a little faith? Yes, very little.

Believe today, just a little that it can happen (unless of course God's answer is no, in that case his alternative is best.)

Believe in the his love one more time, for you. (*FAITH is energized by love.)

Something awesome will happen.
