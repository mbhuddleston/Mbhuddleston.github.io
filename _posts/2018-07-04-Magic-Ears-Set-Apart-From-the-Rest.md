## What Makes [Magic Ears](https://t.mmears.com/?referralCode=T128464) Unique?!

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/magicears.jpg)

Below you will find my first Youtube VIDEOS!!  I explain what makes [Magic Ears](https://t.mmears.com/?referralCode=T128464) special to other companies.  I really like their cancellation policy.  It is literally one of the best.  However, I'm finding they are a little hard on teachers and expect too much perfection.  I still like working with them however, I plan to continue showing videos of various companies so you can get a view of what to expect as an ESL teacher.
