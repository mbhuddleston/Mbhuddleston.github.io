## Palfish a Review

If you’re a native English speaker, then you certainly can make money through this tutoring application.
You don’t need any teaching experience or any type of qualifications to teach in this application.
All you need to do is video chat with your student straight from your phone to earn money!

### What is [Palfish](https://www.ipalfish.com/klian/web/dist/teacher/mobile/invite/teacher_invite.html?uid=6722746)?
Specifically, [Palfish](https://www.ipalfish.com/klian/web/dist/teacher/mobile/invite/teacher_invite.html?uid=6722746) is a mobile app available on both the Android and iOS, that lets you earn money by teaching English online through video calls.

It is the ONLY platform I have found in which interaction with students is allowed.  The app follows the pattern of social media and you can do postings and message students, other teachers, and parents.  It is a really neat way to learn more about your students and interact with teachers from around the world.

Teaching English online is a popular way to make some money while traveling in South East Asia.
The app is popular because students want to put themselves in a natural English speaking environment so they can quickly learn English.

But you don’t necessarily have to be a native-English speaker.
Just having the ability to speak English as a native speaker is often enough. 
The app was originally designed specifically for Chinese speaking nationals looking to learn English, but you might find students from other countries as well.
Let’s take a look at the details.

### How to Get Started with [Palfish](https://www.ipalfish.com/klian/web/dist/teacher/mobile/invite/teacher_invite.html?uid=6722746)?

Remember, it’s a mobile based application, so you’re going to need to whip out your phone and open that App Store.

_**Option 2:**_Sign up for the Freetalk/Seminar Side in which You Set the Rate.

What’s Good About [PalFish](https://www.ipalfish.com/klian/web/dist/teacher/mobile/invite/teacher_invite.html?uid=6722746)?

There are quite a few pros to using [Palfish](https://www.ipalfish.com/klian/web/dist/teacher/mobile/invite/teacher_invite.html?uid=6722746), some are listed below:

#### Flexible Time Schedule
One reason why this application is popular among teachers is that you can set your own hours.
Traditional teaching jobs can be very stressful and time consuming while apps like PalFish let’s you choose how much you want to work and when.

It’s important to remember that the majority of the clients are from China, so you will have to keep that in mind when setting up class dates. 

#### Location Independent
Another benefit of PalFish is that you only need a mobile phone with a working webcam and mic to tutor.
Most tutoring programs online request that you have a high definition webcam and microphone.
You will usually need to use your laptop or PC in order to be able to work for them. 
Fortunately, with PalFish it’s very easy and convenient to get started. You can also literally work anywhere at any time.
Note that how much money you make depends heavily on how much your clients like you.
Having a good quality camera and mic will certainly give you an edge.
Student’s have 10 minutes of time where they can talk to a teacher free of charge.
This is kind of like an interview stage where they decide if you are worth their money.
With this in mind, staying online more often gives you a higher chance of getting a client.

#### Set Your Own Rates or Join the [Official Kids Course]((https://www.ipalfish.com/klian/web/dist/teacher/mobile/invite/teacher_invite.html?uid=6722746)) or do [BOTH]((https://www.ipalfish.com/klian/web/dist/teacher/mobile/invite/teacher_invite.html?uid=6722746)) and be paid a set fee

Most tutoring programs have fixed rates that are generally pretty low.
The cool thing about PalFish is that you can set your own rates!
Since the application is based in China, so you will be payed in Chinese Yuan.

### What Should I Charge? 

When you are just getting started, we recommend that you set your prices on the lower end of the spectrum.
Since the application has a rating system, it’s smart to start cheap to garner some positive reviews.
Once you start getting more students and reviews, then you can begin to charge more per hour.
Of course, it helps that you have real-life teaching experience or an attractive portfolio.
Your education is also very important, especially to Chinese students, as education is highly respected in Chinese culture. 
Most students will flock to you if you have a legitimate bachelor’s degree or higher. And you don’t even have to have a degree in the same field.
Your clients will be willing to pay more if they know that you’ve finished any type of degree.
Remember, you will basically be competing with teachers across the globe. 
So all in all, if you have experience and higher education, then charging over $20 USD per hour isn’t unheard of.
On the other hand, if you are just a native speaker who’s just starting off in this field, then around $10 USD per hour should do the trick.

So [Palfish](https://www.ipalfish.com/klian/web/dist/teacher/mobile/invite/teacher_invite.html?uid=6722746) is one way to practice teaching English online.
