title: First Fully Booked Day of GC (Group Classes)
---
## This week my GC is FULLY BOOKED!

I am going to update how it goes.  The holidays are OVER (for now :)) and my week of GC is fully booked for 4 of my days.  In between each class there will be a 15 minute break.  So rather than go 25 (and I usually go over)  and off 5 minutes.  I will go 45 and be off 15 minutes.  This will probably end up being better as it will allow more time to go to the Restroom, get a snack, coffee, exercise to AWAKEN(early hours), or even review the next lesson if needed.

I am truly excited and look forward to posting my results.  I will either be more tired or less tired!  But I am sure it will be a fun experience meeting new kids.  

Also, these classes pay a tad bit more for the base pay so that will be fantastic!
