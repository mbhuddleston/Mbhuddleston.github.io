title: Fun Workout with Young Kids!
---
## Quarantine Workout

FOr all those mom's and dad's at home more with their young kids, I found a great workout video online!  It was a great workout and it's the first video I've ever found with the kids as the resistance.

My son and I have frequently done exercises together, while I carried him and even held him. This workout was really fun and a great workout.  He laughed and had such fun the entire time.  Enjoy and WORKOUT!!
