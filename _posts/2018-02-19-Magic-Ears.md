title: Applying to other ESL Companies
---
## [Magic Ears](https://t.mmears.com?referralCode=T128464)

So I have been researching other ESL companies because I promised I would, and at certain times of the year it becomes necessary to work for other companies due to low bookings.  [51 Talk](http://www.51talk.com/na?referrer=4825373) has lifted the ban on working for competing companies in an effort to foster more happiness among teachers.  Due to the season of the years and a LOT of holidays, their bookings have been low.  So now we are FREE to work elsewhere even for a competitor.

With so many in population in China, I do not see how one company could ever service all students.  I do not feel like working at other companies will lower the number of kids they have on board.

[Magic Ears](https://t.mmears.com?referralCode=T128464) so far seems like a company that would be fun to work for.  I have recently discovered many teachers work for them, 51Talk and other ESL companies (apparently they were not worried about the ban LOL).

In fact, an ESL Blogger actually suggested if you want to do well in making money, working for multiple companies is a must, especially at first.  

So here's the scoop on [Magic Ears](https://t.mmears.com?referralCode=T128464).  (Use my link to apply!!)
So far they have an excellent repuation.  The company is new so they have no problem with teachers working at other companies.
