title: Slow September!

<h1><a href="http://www.51talk.com/na?referrer=4825373">51 Talk</a></h1>

<h2>Month 2</h2>

<p>I was afraid the day I had to cancel multiple bookings and take several days off, due to Hurricane Harvey, that I had lost favor with <a href="http://www.51talk.com/na?referrer=4825373">51 Talk</a> families.</p>

<p>However I am happy to announce, this month begins school and according to veteran teachers, it is always super slow until schedules are mapped out.</p>

<p>I also discovered September is Ghost month and there is a National celebration of those dead throughout many different religions in China. </p>

<p>My hope is that soon it will PICK back up! I am getting booked but not filling up as I did at first. :(</p>

<p>On the bright side the hurricane made me so exhausted (not in my head many report this due to the changing weather and stress) I actually couldn&#8217;t wake up for a couple bookings so had I had a lot&#8230; I would be out of all money I earned!! A bright side to everything!</p>
