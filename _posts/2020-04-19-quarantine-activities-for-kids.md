## Create a Church Book for Kids

I was researching online some activities for my child to get him more engaged during all these services we are attending.  I also wanted him to begin learning how to take notes during service.

I stumbled upon these awesome pages on Pinterest.  I will attach my photos and attach the links to get the materials as I did not create them.

I am so excited.  He is a Not reading yet and the sermon notes for nonreaders is a big hit!  We cannot wait to use them tonight!
